# SPARQL.jl

The SPARQL.jl package is a [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) query
generator for Julia. It currently does *not* support parsing SPARQL queries.

To read and write [RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/) in the Turtle,
TriG, N-Triples, and N-Quads formats, see the
[Serd.jl](https://github.com/epatters/Serd.jl) package.
